ChromeFTP
=========

A complete FTP client extension for Google Chrome.

How does it work?
-----------------

This extension uses a NPAPI plugin for accessing the underlying OS file system and socket, as this is not possible with HTML5 only. 
The NPAPI plugin is developed with C++ using the Boost library.
